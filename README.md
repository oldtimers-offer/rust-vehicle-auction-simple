# Rust Backend for Vehicle Auction (Simple)
This Rust backend service is designed to power vehicle auction platforms, focusing on performance, scalability, and simplicity. Built using the Actix web framework and SQLx for database interactions, this project provides a robust foundation for managing vehicle auctions and user interactions.

## Features:
Vehicle Listings: Create, update, and view detailed vehicle listings, including make, model, year, and additional attributes.
Auction Management: Manage active and completed auctions, including start/end times, reserve prices, and auction states.
User Bidding: Enable authenticated users to place and manage bids on vehicles.
Authentication & Authorization: Secure user access and roles to differentiate between buyers, sellers, and admins.
Database Integration: Utilizes SQLx for seamless interaction with PostgreSQL or other compatible databases.
## Tech Stack:
Backend Framework: Actix for asynchronous and high-performance HTTP handling.
Database Layer: SQLx for safe, asynchronous database queries.
Rust Ecosystem: Leverages Rust’s memory safety and concurrency features for a reliable backend.

## Goals:
This project is ideal for developers looking to create or extend vehicle auction platforms. It’s designed to be lightweight, easy to customize, and scalable for production use.

Contributions are welcome to enhance features, improve performance, or add integrations!
